## Description

This is an exercise from Pluralsight course on [AngularJS](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/angular-js) - GetSTarted, authored by Scott Allen ([Go to course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angularjs-get-started/table-of-contents)). The code is organized in branches to make it easy to navigate between develope stages as explained below.

## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/introduction-to-git/table-of-contents).
- You can find documentation and download git [here](https://git-scm.com/doc).

### No need for Node.js or its package manager (npm).

## Install
 
To begin using this material, clone this repository on your prefered destination:

```git
git clone https://github.com/DrGregoryHouse/AngularJS_GetSterted.git
```

## Steps

Switch branches to navigate between steps in the code generation. You can `git checkout` to an 'x' point of the tutorial using:

```git
git checkout step0x
```

To see the changes made between any two lessons use the `git diff` command:

```git
git diff step0?..step0?
```

### Step 0 

This is the initial step on the assesment of building a simple AngularJS web application. To get into the first step (Step 00) go to the root directory of the repository and use:
 
```git
git checkout Step00
```

### Step 1

In this step, the application consumes Github API in a single view. To get into this step use:
 
```git
git checkout Step01
```

### Step 2

This is where search button is implemented.
 
```git
git checkout Step02
```

### Step 3

In this part, username information is placed in a view.
 
```git
git checkout Step03
```

### Step 4

In this step, repositories from a user on Github are queried and displayed. 
 
```git
git checkout Step04
```

### Step 5

In this step, ´ng-include´ is used to organize views.
 
```git
git checkout Step05
```

### Step 6

Final step for best practices. 
 
```git
git checkout Step06
```
