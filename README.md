# Description

This is an exercise from Pluralsight course on AngularJS path __AngularJS GetSTarted__, authored by Scott Allen. The code is organized in branches to make it easy to navigate between develope stages as explained below.

# Steps

Switch branches to navigate between steps in the code generation.

## Step 0 

This is the initial step on the assesment of building a simple AngularJS web application. To get into the first step (Step 0) go to the root directory of the repository and use:
 
```git
git checkout Step00
```

## Step 1

In this step, the application consumes Github API in a single view. To get into this step use:
 
```git
git checkout Step01
```

## Step 2

This is where search button is implemented.
 
```git
git checkout Step02
```

## Step 3

In this part, username information is placed in a view.
 
```git
git checkout Step03
```

## Step 4

In this step, repositories from a user on Github are queried and displayed. 
 
```git
git checkout Step04
```

## Step 5

In this step, ´ng-include´ is used to organize views.
 
```git
git checkout Step05
```

## Step 6

Final step for best practices. 
 
```git
git checkout Step06
```
